We use the most accurate addressing database in the UK, Royal Mail's Postcode Address File.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nImplementation can be finished in minutes. Simply install, apply your key and you can start performing UK address lookups.\n\n**Installation**\n\n```bash\nnpm install ideal-postcodes\n```\n\n**Get an API Key**\n\nGet a key at [Ideal-Postcodes.co.uk](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk). Try out the service with the test postcode 'ID1 1QD'\n\n**Configuration**\n\nInclude your api key when requiring the ideal-postcodes module, will return an instance that you can use to make lookups.\n\n```javascript\nvar api_key = \"your key goes here\"\nvar idealPostcodes = require('ideal-postcodes')(api_key)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPerform lookups by calling #lookupPostode. Test using the postcode \"ID1 1QD\".\n\nIf no addresses are found, the method will return an empty array.\n\n```javascript\nidealPostcodes.lookupPostcode(\"ID1 1QD\", function (error, result) {\n\tif (error) throw error; // Implement some error handling\n\tconsole.log(result); \t\n});\n\n// => Will output an array of addresses\n//  {\n//    \"result\": [\n//      {\n//        \"postcode\": \"ID1 1QD\",\n//        \"post_town\": \"LONDON\",\n//        \"line_1\": \"Kingsley Hall\",\n//        \"line_2\": \"Powis Road\",\n//        \"line_3\": \"\"\n//      }\n//    ],\n//    \"code\": 2000,\n//    \"message\": \"Success\"\n//  }\n\n```\n\n## Registering\n\nPAF is licensed from the Royal Mail and is, unfortunately, not free to use. Ideal Postcodes aims to be simple to use and fairly priced to use for web and mobile developers.\n\nWe charge _2p_ per [external](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/termsandconditions#external) lookup.\n\n## Documentation\nMore documentation can be found [here](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation)\n\n## License\nMIT",
